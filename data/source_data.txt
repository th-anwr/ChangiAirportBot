What to know and look out for, to clear immigration swiftly.
For express immigration self-clearance, travellers can use the automated gates.
All travellers can enjoy the convenience of automated clearance when they depart Singapore via Changi Airport if their biometrics have been enrolled during arrival immigration clearance.
Travellers can use automated clearance as long as they hold a valid International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) compliant passport.
For more information, please refer to ICA’s website
The Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS) allows eligible tourists to claim a refund of the GST that you paid on goods purchased from the participating retailers if they are brought out of Singapore via Changi Airport or Seletar Airport.
To be eligible for a GST refund under this scheme, you must satisfy all the following criteria:
*For the definition of Specified Person, please refer to the GST Refund Guide for Visitors on Tourist Refund Scheme (link below)
The eTRS is a paperless process; you will not receive any eTRS ticket, and purchases will be tagged to your passport. If you wish to claim GST Refund on your purchases, you should present your passport to the retailers upon payment. To review or select your purchases for GST Refund, you may wish to visit the e-services portal at https://touristrefund.sg.
Applying for GST Refund can be done at GST Refund facilities at the terminal of your departure. For claims on items to be checked-in, GST Refund has to be done before your flight check-in. For claims on hand-carried items, GST Refund has to be done in departure transit after clearing immigration.
Don’t forget to collect your original receipt or invoice before leaving the shop.
As eTRS is a voluntary scheme, not all retailers in Singapore operate the scheme. GST-registered retailers may choose to operate the scheme on their own or engage the services of a Central Refund Agency.
There are currently three Central Refund Agencies in Singapore:
Global Blue Singapore Pte. Ltd.
Global Tax Free Pte. Ltd.
Retailers who operate the scheme on their own usually display signs that indicate 'Tax Refund' in their shops. However, it is best that you check with the retailers if they are operating the scheme.
The actual amount refunded may be lesser than the GST you have paid as a handling fee for the refund service will be deducted by the retailer, Central Refund Agency or operator of Central Refund Counter.
Do arrive at the airport early to allow sufficient time for your GST refund to be processed and goods to be inspected, if necessary. You are required to seek endorsement at the Customs Inspection Counter in the terminal where you will be checking-in your goods or where your flight will be departing from. You must also depart with the goods on a flight within 12 hours after obtaining approval of your GST refund.

For travellers who prefer to purchase physical coupons or drive foreign cars without an In-Vehicle unit, you may do so here.
With the revised carpark rates, you may purchase our single or bundle Park & Work eCoupons to offset up to 14 hours of parking duration (worth S$36.40), with any parking duration in excess of 14 hours to be charged at prevailing carpark rates.
Please refer to the table below for the outstanding parking charges in the various parking duration scenarios:
We have introduced the option of purchasing a single Park & Work eCoupon to cater to your less frequent ad-hoc visits to Changi Airport at a discounted price of S$22 each (usual price: S$36.40).
Depending on your frequency of visits, we offer the flexibility of purchasing a bundle of five (5) Park & Work eCoupons at a bundle price of S$80 (or S$16 each), with each eCoupon consisting of the same 14 hours of parking credit (worth S$36.40). Do note that all Park & Work eCoupons are valid for a 90-day period from the purchase date (for example: eCoupons purchased on 1 May 2024 will be valid till 30 July 2024).
Park & Work eCoupons allow customers to enjoy a seamless purchase and use process, as the eCoupons are available for use immediately based on the IU number registered in his Changi Rewards membership account and/or as confirmed by customers at the point of activating eCoupons .
There is hence no need to physically collect the physical coupons, and customers do not have to remove the cashcard prior to exit as the activated eCoupon would automatically be used to offset up to S$36.40 worth of parking charges. Any remaining charges can then be paid via cashcard.
Park & Work eCoupons differ from the Park & Work physical parking coupons, and they are not inter-changeable or exchangeable. CAG reserves the right to charge a different price, or phase out the Park & Work physical parking coupons sold on iShopChangi.
All Park & Work eCoupons are valid for a 90-day period from the day of purchase, for example eCoupons purchased on 1 May 2024 will be valid till 30 July 2024. No extensions or refunds will be provided for any un-utilised/expired eCoupons.
Park & Work eCoupons can only be used at the existing 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B multi-storey car parks and/or Hub and Spoke car park.
Please note that Park & Work eCoupons cannot be used at the following car parks:
Park & Work eCoupons are offered to airport staff as an alternative if they choose to park at Changi Airport for the duration of their work day. Given the higher parking demand from the public at T1/Jewel car park and to ensure sufficient parking capacity is made available to the public, Park & Work eCoupons will hence only be applicable to 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B car parks and/or Hub and Spoke carpark only.
Each Park & Work eCoupon will be able to offset up to 14 hours of parking duration (worth S$36.40). The prevailing car park rate of S$0.65 per 15 mins block will apply for any parking duration in excess of 14 hours.
Yes, you can use the other parking privileges or rebates given to you by CAG, such as free parking for having met the spend criteria at terminal public areas, parking privileges under the Changi Rewards loyalty programme, or parking benefits accorded under CarPass etc, together with your Park & Work eCoupon.
Your parking rebates / privileges / redemptions will be stacked in the following order of priority (with the items on top with higher precedence):
Order 1: Park & Work eCoupon (a maximum of one eCoupon can be used per carpark exit at Terminals 2, 3 and 4 only);
Order 2: Parking rewards redeemed under the Changi Airport and Jewel Changi Airport promotions through CarPass, for having met the spend criteria;
Order 3: Parking rewards redeemed under the Changi Rewards loyalty programme, for having met the spend criteria;
Order 4: Parking privileges under the Changi Rewards loyalty programme (for Monarch,Platinum and Gold members);
Order 5: Any other form of parking benefits accorded under CarPass;
Order 6: Park & Fly eCoupon (a maximum of one eCoupon can be used per carpark exit);
Order 7: Parking rebates redeemed with Changi Rewards points;
Order 8: Other physical car park coupon (a maximum of one physical coupon may be used).
Customers are encouraged to verify through CarPass, the eligible parking redemptions, privileges or benefits available to them for that day, before they decide whether to activate the Park & Work eCoupon. The order above is subject to changes and customers may refer to https://carpass.changiairport.com/FAQ.html for latest updates.
Park & Work eCoupons are credited to your Changi Rewards account on an “inactive” basis after you purchase the eCoupons.
Users are required to activate a Park & Work eCoupon before his intended usage, where the eCoupon will then be seamlessly tagged to the IU number within 5 minutes of activation, and will then be used when the vehicle’s IU number is being read at the carpark exit gantry. We recommend that the Park & Work eCoupon be activated preferably at the start of your visit, to safeguard against the user being unable to activate the eCoupon just before your intended exit.
Prevailing rates of S$0.65 per 15 mins block will apply for your parking duration if there is no active eCoupon upon your exit.
CAG will not provide any refunds for parking charges paid via cashcard (if the eCoupon is not activated for any reason, e.g. lack of internet connectivity on user’s end) or for any partially/fully utilised eCoupon, regardless of circumstances, and particularly if the Customer chooses to exit the car park less than 5 minutes upon his eCoupon activation.
Once the eCoupon has been activated, it cannot be returned to inactive status. You can find all your eCoupons on CarPass’s ‘My eCoupons’ page, including the active, inactive and used eCoupons.
We recommend that the Park & Work eCoupon be activated preferably at the start of your visit, to safeguard against the user being unable to activate the eCoupon just before your intended exit.
Activating the eCoupon on a per use basis ensures that it is used only when the Customer intends to do so. For example, a Customer may have 3 unused Park & Work eCoupons in his Changi Rewards membership account, but is only visiting Changi Airport for a 1 hour duration and wishes to pay the charges via his cashcard. As long as he does not activate any eCoupon, the Customer will be able to pay the charges via cashcard, and his 3 unused eCoupons would remain valid for future visits.
Once a Park & Work eCoupon has been activated and used, CAG will not be able to reinstate the used eCoupon. No refunds nor any replacement Park & Work eCoupon will be provided. Please activate the eCoupon only when you are certain on using the eCoupon and before your intended exit from the carpark.
We will not refund the car park charges which you had paid using the cashcard. However, you may continue to utilise the activated (but unused) Park & Work eCoupon, for future use within the stipulated validity period.
Should there be a need to amend the in-vehicle unit (IU) number, you can update your vehicle details using the CarPass portal (go into Changi App > My Carpass > My eCoupons, and click onto “Update your details”), regardless whether the eCoupon has been activated or not. Do note that the IU number registered in your Changi Rewards membership account will be updated accordingly with the updated IU number and this update will apply to all of your existing eCoupons, parking privileges and parking rebates, as well as future parking redemptions made via the CarPass portal.
Please note that changes to your IU less than 5 minutes of exit may not be reflected in time, and full parking charges may apply. No refunds will be provided.
Yes, Park & Work eCoupons can be used on weekends and for overnight parking, up to the maximum eCoupon value of S$36.40.
All Park & Work eCoupons are for single-use and any remaining balance in your Park & Work eCoupon will be forfeited and cannot be used for another visit.
Only a maximum of 1 Park & Work eCoupon may be activated (and used) at any point in time. However, the Customer may use the Park & Work eCoupon together with other types of eCoupons available under CarPass.
Please utilise all Park & Work eCoupons within 90 days from the date of purchase. No extensions or refunds will be provided for any un-utilised or expired eCoupons.
The Park & Work eCoupons are sold as a single coupon or in a bundle of 5, and can only be refunded in the same purchased quantity – provided the single eCoupon or all 5 eCoupons within the bundle purchased have not been activated nor redeemed. A cancellation fee of S$5 would apply in such an instance, and the Customer may write in to parkandwork@changiairport.com to request for such a refund. The cancellation fee is not waivable.
No refunds (full or partial) will be allowed, as long as one or more eCoupons (out of the bundle purchased) or single Park & Work eCoupon has been activated or redeemed.
No changes may be made to the type of Park & Work eCoupon once it is purchased. The Customer may write in to parkandwork@changiairport.com to request for a refund provided that the Park & Work eCoupon bundle has been purchased and the originally purchased single Park & Work eCoupon is not activated or redeemed. A non-waivable cancellation fee of S$5 would apply in such an instance.
The Park & Work eCoupon scheme is being offered as a temporary scheme. CAG reserves the right to discontinue the sale of the Park & Work eCoupon scheme at any time without prior notice. However, we will continue to honour all existing purchases already made, and such eCoupons issued will continue to be valid for a 90-day period from the day of purchase.
Please direct all feedback or enquiries to parkandwork@changiairport.com and we will endeavor to respond to you within 3 working days. Our terms and conditions for Park & Work eCoupons can be viewed under the 'Terms & Conditions' tab above.
Park & Fly eCoupons allow customers to enjoy a seamless purchase and use process, as the eCoupons are available for use immediately based on the IU number registered in his Changi Rewards membership account and/or as confirmed by customers at the point of activating eCoupons.
There is hence no need to physically collect the physical coupons, and customers do not have to remove the cashcard prior to exit as the activated eCoupon would automatically be used to offset the parking charges (based on the value of the parking duration purchased). Any remaining charges will be paid via cashcard.
Park & Fly eCoupons differ from the Park & Fly physical parking coupons, and they are not inter-changeable or exchangeable. CAG reserves the right to charge a different price, or phase out the Park & Fly physical parking coupons sold on iShopChangi.
All Park & Fly eCoupons are valid for a 90-day period from the day of purchase, for example eCoupons purchased on 1 May 2024 will be valid till 30 July 2024. No extensions or refunds will be provided for any un-utilised/expired eCoupons.
Park & Fly eCoupons can only be used at the existing Jewel/T1 (General – B3 to B5 only), 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B multi-storey car parks and/or Hub and Spoke car park.
Please note that Park & Fly eCoupons cannot be used at the following car parks:
If your total parking duration exceeds the purchased parking duration, you will have to pay for the parking duration in excess of the purchased parking duration of your eCoupon at the prevailing standard parking rate of the relevant car park. Payment for the excess parking duration can be made via a payment card (i.e. cashcard, FlashPay card or CEPAS enabled card), upon your exit from the car park.
Only a maximum of 1 Park & Fly eCoupon may be activated (and used) at any point in time. As long as the original eCoupon has not been activated, you are recommended to purchase a new Park & Fly eCoupon with the revised parking duration, and then activate the new eCoupon before your intended exit from the carpark. You may then write in to parkandfly@changiairport.com to request for a refund of your original eCoupon.
Hence, you are recommended to not activate the Park & Fly eCoupon upon entering the carpark, in the event that there are changes to your travel plans. You are recommended to only activate your Park & Fly eCoupon shortly before your intended exit from the carpark, after there is certainty in your required parking duration.
Once a Park & Fly eCoupon has been activated, that eCoupon cannot be inactivated, and you will not be able to activate another eCoupon to offset your desired parking duration.
Yes, you can use the other parking privileges or rebates given to you by CAG, such as free parking for having met the spend criteria at terminal public areas, parking privileges under the Changi Rewards loyalty programme, or parking benefits accorded under CarPass etc, together with your Park & Fly eCoupon.
Your parking rebates / privileges / redemptions will be stacked in the following order of priority (with the items on top with higher precedence):

The order above is subject to changes and Customers may refer to https://carpass.changiairport.com/FAQ.html for latest updates.
Park & Fly eCoupon is credited to your Changi Rewards account on an “inactive” basis after you purchase the eCoupon.
Users are recommended to not activate the Park & Fly eCoupon upon entering the carpark. Instead, please remember to activate your Park & Fly eCoupon only shortly before your intended exit from the carpark, so that you can utilise it during your exit from the carpark. Such eCoupon must be activated no later than 5 minutes before the intended carpark exit.
Prevailing rates of S$0.65 per 15 mins block will apply for your parking duration if there is no active eCoupon upon your exit.
CAG will not provide any refunds for parking charges paid via cashcard (if the eCoupon is not activated for any reason, e.g. lack of internet connectivity on user’s end) or for any partially/fully utilised eCoupon, regardless of circumstances, and particularly if the Customer chooses to exit the car park less than 5 minutes after his eCoupon activation.
Once the eCoupon has been activated, it cannot be returned to inactive status. You can find all your eCoupons at CarPass’s ‘My eCoupons’ page, including the active, inactive and used eCoupons.
Activation of an inactive Park & Fly eCoupon can only be done earliest one day before your planned exit date. This is to ensure that you activate your eCoupon only before you intend to exit the carpark. Should you intend to activate or utilise your Park & Fly eCoupon immediately or on another day, you may update your new planned exit date on your eCoupon (go into Changi App > My Carpass > My eCoupons, and click on the pencil icon beside your planned exit date), provided that the eCoupon has not been activated or utilised.
Activating the eCoupon on a per use basis ensures that it is used only when the Customer intends to do so. For example, a Customer may have an unused Park & Fly eCoupon in his Changi Rewards membership account, but is only visiting Changi Airport for a 1 hour duration and wishes to pay the charges via his cashcard. As long as he did not activate any eCoupon, the Customer will be able to pay the charges via cashcard, and his unused eCoupon would remain valid for future visits.
Once a Park & Fly eCoupon has been activated and used, CAG will not be able to reinstate the used eCoupon. No refunds nor any replacement Park & Fly eCoupon will be provided. The Customer is recommended to activate the eCoupon only on the intended day of usage.
We will not refund the car park charges which you had paid using the cashcard. However, you may continue to utilise the activated (but unused) Park & Fly eCoupon, for future use within the stipulated validity period.
Should there be a need to amend the in-vehicle unit (IU) number, you can update your vehicle details using the CarPass portal (go into Changi App > My Carpass > My eCoupons, and click onto “Update your details”), regardless whether the eCoupon has been activated or not. Do note that the IU number registered in your Changi Rewards membership account will be updated accordingly with the updated IU number and this update will apply to all of your existing eCoupons, parking privileges and parking rebates, as well as future parking redemptions made via the CarPass portal.
Please note that changes to your IU less than 5 minutes of exit may not be reflected in time, and full parking charges may apply. No refunds will be provided.
You may amend or update your new planned exit date on the Park & Fly eCoupon after your purchase (go into Changi App > My Carpass > My eCoupons, and click on the pencil icon beside your planned exit date), as long as the eCoupon has not been activated or utilised.
All Park & Fly eCoupons are valid for a 90-day period from the day of purchase, and are independent of your input for the planned carpark exit date.
All Park & Fly eCoupons are for single-use and any remaining balance in your Park & Fly eCoupon will be forfeited and cannot be used for another visit.

Most airlines operating out of Changi Airport offer the option to check in online, allowing passengers to select their seats and print their boarding passes from the convenience of their home or office.

b) Similarly, if you are transiting via a U.S.A. airport to another U.S.A. or non-U.S.A. destination, you will have the opportunity to reclaim your check-in luggage before passing through U.S.A. customs, and your LAGs purchase must be placed in your check-in luggage prior to checking in for your connecting flight.

What to know and look out for, to clear immigration swiftly.
For express immigration self-clearance, travellers can use the automated gates.
All travellers can enjoy the convenience of automated clearance when they depart Singapore via Changi Airport if their biometrics have been enrolled during arrival immigration clearance.
Travellers can use automated clearance as long as they hold a valid International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) compliant passport.
For more information, please refer to ICA’s website
The Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS) allows eligible tourists to claim a refund of the GST that you paid on goods purchased from the participating retailers if they are brought out of Singapore via Changi Airport or Seletar Airport.
To be eligible for a GST refund under this scheme, you must satisfy all the following criteria:
*For the definition of Specified Person, please refer to the GST Refund Guide for Visitors on Tourist Refund Scheme (link below)
The eTRS is a paperless process; you will not receive any eTRS ticket, and purchases will be tagged to your passport. If you wish to claim GST Refund on your purchases, you should present your passport to the retailers upon payment. To review or select your purchases for GST Refund, you may wish to visit the e-services portal at https://touristrefund.sg.
Applying for GST Refund can be done at GST Refund facilities at the terminal of your departure. For claims on items to be checked-in, GST Refund has to be done before your flight check-in. For claims on hand-carried items, GST Refund has to be done in departure transit after clearing immigration.
Don’t forget to collect your original receipt or invoice before leaving the shop.
As eTRS is a voluntary scheme, not all retailers in Singapore operate the scheme. GST-registered retailers may choose to operate the scheme on their own or engage the services of a Central Refund Agency.
There are currently three Central Refund Agencies in Singapore:
Global Blue Singapore Pte. Ltd.
Global Tax Free Pte. Ltd.
Retailers who operate the scheme on their own usually display signs that indicate 'Tax Refund' in their shops. However, it is best that you check with the retailers if they are operating the scheme.
The actual amount refunded may be lesser than the GST you have paid as a handling fee for the refund service will be deducted by the retailer, Central Refund Agency or operator of Central Refund Counter.
Do arrive at the airport early to allow sufficient time for your GST refund to be processed and goods to be inspected, if necessary. You are required to seek endorsement at the Customs Inspection Counter in the terminal where you will be checking-in your goods or where your flight will be departing from. You must also depart with the goods on a flight within 12 hours after obtaining approval of your GST refund.
For check-in items:
Prior to checking-in the goods, please proceed to the eTRS self-help kiosk at the Departure Check-in Hall (before Departure Immigration) to apply for GST Refund.
For hand-carried items:
Please proceed to the eTRS self-help kiosk at Departure Transit Lounge (after Departure Immigration) to apply for GST Refund.
At the kiosk, you will be asked to:
Once you have completed the steps above, you will be shown the status of your refund on the kiosk. If your purchases need to be inspected, please proceed to the Customs Inspection Counter for the physical inspection of the goods. Please present the goods, together with your passport, the original invoice(s) or receipt(s) and your confirmed flight itinerary or boarding pass to the Customs Inspection Counter for endorsement.
Refund via Credit Card
The approved refund amount will be credited to the specified credit card within 10 calendar days.
Refund via Cash
Please proceed to the GST Cash Refund Counter in the Departure Transit Lounge (after Departure Immigration) to collect your cash.
Refund via Alipay
Follow through the instructions at the kiosks or counter to receive your Alipay refund.
The GST refund counters are located at both public and transit areas, and are open 24 hours, daily.
Terminal 1
Terminal 2
Terminal 3

1.7. Without limitation to any other rights or remedies that CAG may have under law, CAG may do any one or more of the following if CAG suspects or determines that a Cardholder (whether alone or with others) has engaged in fraudulent or unauthorized activity in connection with his Changi Rewards account and/or Changi Rewards Card (such Cardholder referred to as “Fraudulent Cardholder”, and such activity referred to as “Fraud Action”):-

Any changes in the Terms and Conditions shall be effective from the date of publishing the revised Terms and Conditions in the foregoing manner.

1.13. All Changi Rewards points have no monetary value and can only be earned, redeemed or utilised in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. Any other use, including but not limited to the sale, trade, transfer or exchange of Changi Reward points are strictly not allowed and will result in the forfeiture of the points in question, cancellation of rewards or immediate termination of Changi Rewards membership without prejudice to any rights or remedies available to CAG at law or in contract.

4.2. With a minimum Nett Spend of S$10 in a single receipt, eligible Cardholders will be awarded with Changi Rewards points based on the following earn rate:

a) Member tier Cardholders – 5,000 points;

a) A Gold tier Cardholder with a Nett Spend of S$38 in a single receipt will be entitled to 60 Changi Reward points (i.e. receipt amount rounded down to nearest S$10 block and multiplied by the Gold tier earn rate of 20 points per S$10 Nett Spend); and

4.4. In calculating the Nett Spend, all discounts given and amounts paid using vouchers (including, but not limited to, Changi e-Voucher(s) and Changi e-Voucher(s) Flexi) shall be excluded, i.e. such amounts are to be excluded when calculating the total qualifying spend in a single receipt.

Cardholders are not entitled to claim or collect points on transactions entered into prior to the date of their enrollment in the Programme.
4.7. In the event that: (i) the Changi Rewards machine is not working in the relevant outlet at the time of transaction; or (ii) Cardholders forget to present their Changi Rewards Card at the time of transaction, CAG may, as a discretionary gesture of goodwill, credit Changi Rewards points to the subject Cardholders if the relevant receipts for qualifying transactions are sent to Changi Rewards through the Contact Us webform or chat with MAX. Such receipt(s) must be in good condition and not more than 7 days old as at the date CAG receives such receipts. Changi Rewards points will only be credited for retrospective claims made by registered Cardholders at the point of transaction. CAG reserves the right at its sole discretion to decline to credit Changi Rewards points for transactions in this manner if CAG has reasonable grounds for believing that one or more of the claims being submitted is either fraudulent or not in compliance with these Terms and Conditions, and in all circumstances CAG’s decision shall be final.

4.10. In the event where the purchases were made without the requisite Changi Rewards points being credited to the relevant Cardholder, such Cardholder shall (if intending to claim the relevant Changi Reward points) furnish the necessary proof of purchase (i.e. receipts). CAG will, at its sole and absolute discretion, accept or reject any such claims.
4.11. Changi Rewards points earned cannot be transferred to any other Changi Rewards Card(s)/ Cardholder(s), or to any third party, and are not exchangeable for any form of cash or credit.
4.12. Changi Rewards points can only be awarded for the Cardholder's own purchases. If any Cardholder is found using receipts other than his own purchases to accumulate points, CAG reserves the right to terminate the use of that Cardholder’s Changi Rewards Card.
4.13. CAG may, at its sole and absolute discretion, increase or decrease the rate of Changi Rewards points to be awarded for selected purchases or transactions.

Shop guilt-free with GST-absorbed purchases at the public areas in the airport.
GST in Singapore has increased to 9% from 1st January 2024. Participating retail outlets in Changi Airport will continue to absorb GST for retail spends in public areas of Terminals 1 to 4 for eligible Changi Rewards members.
How It Works
Sample receipt:
For GST-registered retail outlets, the display price includes GST. Therefore, in this sample transaction, GST would already be included in the price of the item (SGD100).
Highlighted green label is the discount equivalent to a 9% GST amount based on GST-inclusive pricing (9/109 x SGD100 = SGD8.26).
The final price of the item is SGD100 - SGD8.26 = SGD91.74.

12. GPS APP AND USAGE
12.1 For non-treadmill results that are submitted to the Organiser for the Virtual Run Fundraising Challenge, the Participant must submit the results via designated GPS-based mobile apps used to track athletic activity via satellite navigation and then upload and share such activities. The compatible GPS-enabled apps to clock the running distance, time, and route for the run are STRAVA and GARMIN. If a Participant uses other GPS- enabled apps, the Participant may need to manually upload the information onto the Website. The Organiser reserves the right to reject any such manually uploaded data if they have reasonable grounds to believe that the data has been tampered with or altered.
12.2 As with any GPS app or mobile data device, the accuracy of the location information shown on the tracking panel depends on, amongst other things, the quality of the connection between the Participant’s device and the GPS satellites and the connection with the mobile phone network. These can be affected by environmental factors such as bad weather or the presence of tall buildings and information can be delayed, corrupted or lost. The information on the tracking panel is therefore to be regarded as being a guide to the location of the device at the time of the last update received from it and is subject to error. The use of the device and any of the GPS exercise tracking apps will be the responsibility of the Participant, and at the Participant’s own risk. The Organiser does not take any responsibility for the use of the device nor any GPS exercise tracking app, nor for any injury or death that may be caused to the Participant from such use. The usage of GPS routes is to showcase the distance completed by the Participant based on results submitted to ensure fair play among all Participants. If at any time the Organiser believes that a Participant has breached the Terms and Conditions or the terms of any other agreement with them or are using the Participant’s device and the GPS exercise tracking app in an improper or illegal manner or otherwise in a manner as to materially adversely affect the Official Website and/or Event account, the Organiser may immediately terminate or suspend the Participant’s use of the Event account and/or Official Website without notice.
12.3 For treadmill results, the Participant must manually submit their results via the Official Website, accompanied by clear and accurate photo evidence in accordance with the submission guidelines. The Organiser reserves the right to reject any manually submitted data if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the data is incomplete, inaccurate, tampered with, or otherwise does not comply with the stated guidelines.

Our Story
It first began with the need to expand the capacity of Changi Airport’s Terminal 1 as well as its open-air carpark. This led to a strategic vision with the conception of Jewel as a gem of a destination, to augment Changi Airport’s position as a leading air hub globally and boost its appeal as a stopover destination for travellers.
The stunning result is a mixed-use development with gardens, attractions, retail, dining, a hotel and facilities to support airport operations. This integration of nature with engineering marvels housed under a striking glass and steel dome is poised to make headlines.
The Partnership
A partnership between Changi Airport Group and CapitaLand was forged, resulting in a meaningful collaboration between two truly Singaporean companies and the creation of the country’s next iconic landmark.
