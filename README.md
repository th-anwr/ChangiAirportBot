# Changi Airport Chatbot (FastAPI + Ollama + FAISS)

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for Changi Airport and Jewel, powered by local embeddings, FAISS, and an LLM served by Ollama. Exposes a secure FastAPI web API for easy integration and sharing.

---

## Features

- **Local Knowledge Base:** Uses your own `source_data.txt` for airport info.
- **LLM-Powered:** Uses Ollama (e.g., Llama3) for natural language answers.
- **FastAPI Web API:** Easily deployable and accessible via HTTP.
- **API Key Security:** Protects your endpoint with an API key.
- **No External Web Search:** All answers are from your local data or static flight status info.

## Security

- All API requests require the correct API key.
- Do not share your API key publicly.

## Example cURL Request

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Where can I eat at Changi Airport?", "api_key": "your-secret-api-key"}'
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure Ollama is running and the model is pulled.
- Ensure `data/source_data.txt` exists and is not empty.
- Check your API key matches the serverâ€™s.
